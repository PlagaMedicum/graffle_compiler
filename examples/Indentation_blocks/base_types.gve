v1 = 12 @ int vertice
v2 = true @ boolean s here
v3 = "Why do we all must to wear those ridiculous ties?!" @[ This was
a question]

e1 = v1 -> v2 @ not weighted oriented arc
e2 = v2 -- v3 @ not weighted not oriented arc
e3 = v1 -[1]-> v2 @ weighted oriented arc

g1 = (G) e1 @ graph converted from arc
g2 = (G) g1 + v3 @ graph converted from summ of graph and vertice

g = g1 + g2 @ summ of graphs
g = g1 * g2 @ let's change the label
g = g1 - g2, e1 ``` and there is no label, as you see
